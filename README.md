# EDA_PowerCo

## Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook for the PowerCo dataset, developed as part of a BCG Data Science task. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior, pricing trends, and churn patterns using Python and visualization libraries.

## Project Description
The EDA explores two datasets:
- **Client Data**: Contains customer information such as consumption, churn status, and sales channels.
- **Price Data**: Includes pricing details like off-peak, peak, and mid-peak variable and fixed prices over time.

The goal is to perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations to derive insights for business decision-making.
